#### **Instructions**
Answer all questions. For Questions 1-2, provide detailed written responses showing your problem formulations. For Questions 3-5, complete the Python code as instructed to implement search algorithms.

### **Question 1: Robot Maze Navigation (25 Marks)**

Your goal is to navigate a robot out of a maze. The robot starts in the center of the maze facing north. You can turn the robot to face north, east, south, or west. You can direct the robot to move forward a certain distance, although it will stop before hitting a wall.

1. **Formulate this problem. How large is the state space?** (6 marks)
   
   *Provide a complete problem formulation including: initial state, actions, transition model, goal test, and path cost. Calculate the size of the state space.*

2. **In navigating a maze, the only place we need to turn is at the intersection of two or more corridors. Reformulate this problem using this observation. How large is the state space now?** (6 marks)
   
   *Reformulate the problem with the reduced state space and explain how the size changes.*

3. **From each point in the maze, we can move in any of the four directions until we reach a turning point, and this is the only action we need to do. Reformulate the problem using these actions. Do we need to keep track of the robot's orientation now?** (7 marks)
   
   *Reformulate the problem with these new actions and discuss whether orientation is still necessary.*

4. **In our initial description of the problem we already abstracted from the real world, restricting actions and removing details. List three such simplifications we made.** (6 marks)
   
   *Identify and explain three simplifications made in the problem formulation.*

---

### **Question 2: Problem Formulations (40 Marks)**

Give a complete problem formulation for each of the following problems. Choose a formulation that is precise enough to be implemented.

For each problem, specify:
- **States**: What does each state represent?
- **Initial State**: What is the starting configuration?
- **Actions**: What actions are available in each state?
- **Transition Model**: What is the result of each action?
- **Goal Test**: How do we know if we've reached the goal?
- **Path Cost**: How do we measure the cost of a solution?

#### **2.1 Glass Boxes Problem (10 marks)**

There are six glass boxes in a row, each with a lock. Each of the first five boxes holds a key unlocking the next box in line; the last box holds a banana. You have the key to the first box, and you want the banana.

*Provide your complete problem formulation here.*

---

#### **2.2 Sequence Transformation Problem (10 marks)**

You start with the sequence ABABAECCEC, or in general any sequence made from A, B, C, and E. You can transform this sequence using the following equalities: AC = E, AB = BC, BB = E, and Ex = x for any x. For example, ABBC can be transformed into AEC, and then AC, and then E. Your goal is to produce the sequence E.

*Provide your complete problem formulation here.*

---

#### **2.3 Floor Painting Problem (10 marks)**

There is an n√ón grid of squares, each square initially being either unpainted floor or a bottomless pit. You start standing on an unpainted floor square, and can either paint the square under you or move onto an adjacent unpainted floor square. You want the whole floor painted.

*Provide your complete problem formulation here.*

---

#### **2.4 Container Ship Unloading Problem (10 marks)**

A container ship is in port, loaded high with containers. There are 13 rows of containers, each 13 containers wide and 5 containers tall. You control a crane that can move to any location above the ship, pick up the container under it, and move it onto the dock. You want the ship unloaded.

*Provide your complete problem formulation here.*

---

### **Question 3: Implementing Breadth-First Search (35 Marks)**

#### **Problem Description**
Implement a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm to solve pathfinding problems in a grid world. üó∫Ô∏è

* The world is represented as a 2D grid where:
  - `0` represents a free cell (can move through)
  - `1` represents a wall (cannot move through)
  - `S` marks the start position
  - `G` marks the goal position
* The agent can move in four directions: up, down, left, right
* BFS explores nodes level by level, guaranteeing the shortest path in unweighted graphs

#### **Your Task**
Complete the Python functions in the starter code below to implement BFS. Your implementation should:
1. Use a queue (FIFO) for the frontier
2. Keep track of explored nodes to avoid cycles
3. Return the path from start to goal
4. Handle cases where no path exists

### **Question 4: Implementing Depth-First Search (35 Marks)**

#### **Problem Description**
Implement a **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm for the same grid world problem. üîç

2. **Performance**: Which algorithm explores more nodes before finding the goal? Why?
3. **Memory Usage**: Which algorithm uses more memory in the worst case? Explain.
4. **Use Cases**: When would you prefer DFS over BFS? When would you prefer BFS over DFS?

### **Question 5: Implementing Uniform Cost Search (35 Marks)**

#### **Problem Description**
Implement **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**, a variant of BFS that accounts for varying edge costs. üí∞

* In this enhanced grid world, different terrain types have different costs:
  - Free cells (0): cost 1
  - Rough terrain (2): cost 5
  - Highway (3): cost 0.5
  - Walls (1): impassable
* UCS expands the node with the lowest path cost first
* UCS guarantees the optimal (lowest cost) path

#### **Your Task**
Implement UCS using a priority queue. The algorithm should find the lowest-cost path, not just the shortest path in terms of number of steps.

#### **Starter Code**
```python
